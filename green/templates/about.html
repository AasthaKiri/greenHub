                    <h1 class="mb-4">Our main goal is to protect environment</h1>
                    <p>For years, the environment has slowly been decaying, slipping away from our grasp, little by
                        little. A few noticed, some didn't. Now is the time for urgent review. Global surface
                        temperature has been measured since 1880 at a network of ground-based and
                        ocean-based sites. Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the Earth has
                        increased by about 1Â°C. The eleven warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980, with
                        2016 the warmest on record.The coastal regions are getting warmer in summers and colder in
                        winters, as the years pass by.
                        The average temperature margin between summers and winters is increasing everywhere. Hundreds of
                        people are getting sick due to the sudden weather change brought about by global warming. The
                        earth is slowly dying and we need to save it, now.</p>
